  As a sports fanatic I wanted to build a simple but interactive NBA website that's not too complicated and just display the important details of every team. For this to work I need a lot of
  Javascript for the DOM and also use an API for the datas and learn to manipulate it for my website. I took every teams color and used it to display their name for better user experience.
   
# Optimizations
  As time goes on I need to add more features and individuals stats for the more hardcore fans for better user experience. I also need to look for a better API. The one I'm using is a little
  limited.

# Lesson Learned
   Going through this, I got better at using and understanding APIs and how to use them basing on my needs. It also improve my Javascript because of all the datas I need to put in the DOM
   real-time depending on what the user requested. This also helped me improved write good, dry and readable code.
